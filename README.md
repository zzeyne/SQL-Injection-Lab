Educational lab on SQL Injection attacks using login forms and URL manipulation
# SQL Injection Lab Report

This repository contains my hands-on lab work for a SQL Injection (SQLi) vulnerability demonstration. The lab was conducted using a vulnerable web application running on a local virtual machine.

## Lab Environment

- Web Application: Vulnerable PHP/MySQL app
- VM OS: Kali Linux (Network Security Lab VM)
- Accessed via: `localhost/sqli-basic` and `localhost/sqli-union`

## Attack Methods Demonstrated

1. SQL Injection via input fields (login bypass)
2. SQL Injection via URL manipulation using `OR` operator
3. SQL Injection via URL using the `UNION` operator

## Screenshots

See `/screenshots` folder or [Lab_SQLi.pdf](./Lab_SQLi.pdf) for full details.
